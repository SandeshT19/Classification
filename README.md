# Machine Learning Classification Models
In this project I am going to understand and analyze the data of bank customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same and any majors to prevent this using the available data.
As I am mostly focusing on coding and the data science technique to understand data and get most of it using Classification models as per my knowledge and understanding in this notebook. I have skip the theory part for the Classification and it functioning which you will get plenty of theoretical material on internet.
Following are the few articles which will help you to get basic understanding and theoretical concept about Logistic Regression and other classification models models

## What Steps we are performing  to achive  above objective:

1) Importing base packages.

2) Data cleaning and summarization.

3) Missing value treatment.

4) Feature engineering and text Columns formatting.

6) Testing multiple regression models and choosing best one.

7) Hyper tuning for the model.

8) Predicting test scores with different matrices.

9) Printing the important features for the prediction as per best model.

10) Conclusion.
