# Machine Learning Classification Models
In this project I am going to understand and analyze the data of bank customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same and any majors to prevent this using the available data.
As I am mostly focusing on coding and the data science technique to understand data and get most of it using Classification models as per my knowledge and understanding in this notebook. I have skip the theory part for the Classification and it functioning which you will get plenty of theoretical material on internet.
Following are the few articles which will help you to get basic understanding and theoretical concept about Logistic Regression and other classification models models

# Project Discription:
The bank Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same and any majors to prevent this using the avaible data .
Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas

# Problem Statment :
As data scientist ,my job is to come up with a model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards and provide the bank key insights from avaible data to improve services.
Data Dictionary:
CLIENTNUM: Client number. Unique identifier for the customer holding the account
Attrition_Flag: Internal event (customer activity) variable - if the account is closed then "Attrited Customer" else "Existing Customer"
Customer_Age: Age in Years
Gender: Gender of the account holder
Dependent_count: Number of dependents
Education_Level: Educational Qualification of the account holder - Graduate, High School, Unknown, Uneducated, College(refers to a college student), Post-- - Graduate, Doctorate.
Marital_Status: Marital Status of the account holder
Income_Category: Annual Income Category of the account holder
Card_Category: Type of Card
Months_on_book: Period of relationship with the bank
Total_Relationship_Count: Total no. of products held by the customer
Months_Inactive_12_mon: No. of months inactive in the last 12 months
Contacts_Count_12_mon: No. of Contacts between the customer and bank in the last 12 months
Credit_Limit: Credit Limit on the Credit Card
Total_Revolving_Bal: The balance that carries over from one month to the next is the revolving balance
Avg_Open_To_Buy: Open to Buy refers to the amount left on the credit card to use (Average of last 12 months)
Total_Trans_Amt: Total Transaction Amount (Last 12 months)
Total_Trans_Ct: Total Transaction Count (Last 12 months)
Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1: Ratio of the total transaction count in 4th quarter and the total transaction count in 1st quarter
Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1: Ratio of the total transaction amount in 4th quarter and the total transaction amount in 1st quarter
Avg_Utilization_Ratio: Represents how much of the available credit the customer spent



## What Steps we are performing  to achive  above objective:

1) Importing base packages.

2) Data cleaning and summarization.

3) Missing value treatment.

4) Feature engineering and text Columns formatting.

6) Testing multiple classification  models and choosing best one.

7) Hyper tuning for the model.

8) Predicting test scores with different matrices.

9) Printing the important features for the prediction as per best model.

10) Conclusion.
